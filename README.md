## Introduction


This repository holds OpenBioMed, a Python deep learning toolkit for AI-empowered biomedicine. OpenBioMed provides **flexible APIs to handle multi-modal biomedical data**, including molecules, proteins, single cells, natural language, and knowledge graphs. OpenBioMed builds **20+ tools that covers a wide range of downstream applications**, ranging from traditional AI drug discovery tasks to newly-emerged multi-modal challenges. Moreover, OpenBioMed provides **an easy-to-use interface for building workflows** that connect multiple tools and developing LLM-driven agents for solving complicated biomedical research tasks.


OpenBioMed provide researchers with access to:


- **4 types of data modalities**:  OpenBioMed provide easy-to-use APIs for researchers to access and process different types of data including molecules, proteins, pockets, and texts. New data structures for DNAs, RNAs, single cells, and knowledge graphs will be available in future versions.
- **20+ tools**, ranging from ML-based prediction models for AIDD tasks including molecule property prediction and protein folding, to visualization tools and web-search APIs. 
- **20+ deep learning models**, comprising exclusive models such as [PharmolixFM](https://cloud.tsinghua.edu.cn/f/8f337ed5b58f45138659/), [BioMedGPT-R1](https://huggingface.co/PharMolix/BioMedGPT-R1), [BioMedGPT](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10767279/) and [MutaPLM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22949).


Key features of OpenBioMed include:


- **Unified Data Processing Pipeline**: easily load and transform the heterogeneous data from different biomedical entities and modalities into a unified format.
- **Off-the-shelf Inference**: publicly available pre-trained models and inference demos, readily to be transferred to your own data or task. 
- **Easy-to-use Interface for Building Workflows and LLM Agents**: flexibly build solutions for complicated research tasks with multi-tool collaborative workflows, and harvest LLMs for simulating trial-and-errors and gaining scientific insights.


Here is a list of currently available tools. This is a continuing effort and we are working on further growing the list.
